#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

What factors promote favourable Saṃskāra?

But Saṃskāra can be fed by Vāsanā.

Everything we do has an origin.

Nothing destroys Vāsana, only they become ineffective.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

Until you can experience without the desire to repeat or reject it,
you are subject to the impact of Saṃskāra or tendencies from the past.
