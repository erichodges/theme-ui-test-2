#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“In the Yoga Sūtra, the pre-eminent text on Dhyānam within Yoga: <br />
Book One is about the Process of the practice of Dhyānam; <br />
Book Two is about the Preparation for the practice of Dhyānam; <br />
Book Three is about the Outcome of the practice of Dhyānam; <br />
Book Four is about the Goal of the practice of Dhyānam.” <br />
