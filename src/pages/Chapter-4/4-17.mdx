#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“According to Patañjali,
even when you have something in front of you, you may not see it.
Even when you don’t have something in front of you but you want to see it,
you will see it.
Everything depends on YOU.
You may think you have a question when in reality you don’t;
or you may not have a question but will find it as well as the answer.”

“According to Patañjali, comprehension is dependent upon two things:

1. Your interest
   and
2. The proximity of the object.
   Apekṣā is the interest of the Puruṣa for the object.
   The success of Dhyāna depends on the force (Śakti) of the Puruṣa
   that pushes the mind to direct itself towards an object.
   Without interest, there is no question and no answer.
   If you have the interest, you will discover the proximity.”

“In observing, we must remember a few more things:
We can only observe when there is an inclination to do so.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“We look at the world through the eyes
of our needs and expectations.”
