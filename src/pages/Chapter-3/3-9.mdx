#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“We can have two opposite Saṃskāra,
but only one can act at any one time.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“The paradox of being in a state of distraction
is that we are actually in a state of focus.
Its just that we are focused on being turned outwards,
as in the tendency of being scattered,
as in Vyutthāna Saṃskāra,
rather than being focused on being turned inwards,
as in the tendency of being contained,
as in Nirodha Saṃskāra.
Both Saṃskāra are acquired tendencies
and thus we can cultivate a choice within our oscillations.”
