#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Even when our understanding is consistent with our perception or repeated experience, it does not necessarily indicate a fact.
For instance, if we assume that a person is a woman simply because that person is dressed in a woman’s clothes, this is called Viparyaya or mental activity that is based on something other than fact.
Viparyaya, then, is comprehension based on a perceived characteristic in the observer, which leads to false assumptions.”

“A particular Dharma is not there,
but somewhere we feel it is there.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“Wrong perception is false knowledge that has no basis.”

“Viparyaya is merely an opinion,
convincing in its rightness to exist.
A flight of fancy, posing, as if a truth.”

“Viparyaya is seeing what we want to see,
or not seeing what we need to see.”
