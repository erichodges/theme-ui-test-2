#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

‎”Right Yoga is a vine of pleasant fragrance.
Wrong Yoga is a sharp pointed arrow – avoid it.”

“In the second and third Sūtra the means to realise Samādhi
and the true nature of Jīva were explained.
The term used in those Sūtra is Draṣṭṛ
– that which perceives and aids in perception.”
– T Krishnamacharya’s commentary to Yoga Sūtra Chapter One verse 23

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“In the Yoga state we experience what is beyond the mind.”

“When the mind is very clear,
you get the message from deep inside.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“From this state, clarity of being,
as vision from the source of perception.”

“Yoga is about refining the skill
to rest in the awareness of the Cit,
rather than nest in the nature of the Citta.”

“To experience the spaciousness of Cit,
Yoga says practice enclosing the Citta.”

“The less we act from within the field of the present moment,
the more we re-act from within the field of past memories.”

“It is difficult to realise the wonders of Cit
within the wanderings of the Citta.”

“Yoga is the experience of stillness,
within the fluctuations of mind,
rather than the experience of stillness,
of the fluctuations of mind.”
