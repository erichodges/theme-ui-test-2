#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Each person possesses a body.
Encased in the body, as it were, he goes through pain and pleasure.
The pain and pleasure through the body arises because of contact with the external world.
However such variations of pain and pleasure do not happen to one absorbed in Īśvara.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

The tendencies born from that experience of knowing oppose other tendencies.
