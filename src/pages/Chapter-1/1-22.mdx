#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

Three types of Śiṣya:

1. The student doesn’t get started e.g. doesn’t get beyond Saṃkalpa
2. The student starts, but when there is an obstacle, stops.
3. The student starts, but when there is an obstacle, takes it as a challenge

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

It is not the number of hours in Meditation,
the type of Ratio in Prāṇāyāma,
the number of times you turn the Mālā,
it is the intensity of the attempt.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

Hence also the distinctions of
mildness,
moderateness and
extremeness.
