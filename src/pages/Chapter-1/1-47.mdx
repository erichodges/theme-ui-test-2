### 1-47

# nirvicāra-vaiśāradye-adhyātma-prasādaḥ

#### निर्विचारवैशारद्येऽध्यात्मप्रसादः

#### On the maturation of refined subtle reflection, the serenity is from the inner essence

<br />

**nirvicārā** - refined subtle reflection <br />

**vaiśāradya** - maturation <br />

**adhyātma** - inner essence <br />

**prasāda** - serenity; a propitiatory offering, the food presented to an idol <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

Until a person has reached a state of Nirvicārā Samādhi life continues to be a mystery.
Whatever he may achieve or know of the world or even of the cosmos, we are ignorant of our own self.
How little we can predict about ourselves, our future, our moods.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

On the maturation of meditational unity,
up to the stage of refined reflection on a subtle object,
the serenity is from the inner essence.
