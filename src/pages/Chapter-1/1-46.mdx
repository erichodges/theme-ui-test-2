### [<](/Chapter-1/1-45) &nbsp 1-46 &nbsp [>](/Chapter-1/1-47/)

# tāḥ eva sabījaḥ samādhiḥ

#### ता एव सबीजस्समाधिः

#### These thus, are integration with seed

<br />

**tat** - that, this <br />

**eva** - thus <br />

**sabīja** - with seed <br />

**samādhi** - putting together; communion; combining; integration <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

These choices for meditational unity on gross or subtle objects,
are all seen as integration with seed.
