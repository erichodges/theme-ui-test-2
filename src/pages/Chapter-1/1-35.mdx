#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“According to my teacher,
trying to calm the agitations of the mind by reflecting on external objects
is like trying to get milk from the wattles hanging from the neck of a goat.
All seekers of truth are therefore advised to focus,
instead, only on objects that are in the realm of the divine.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“Sometimes we should examine how we relate to objects through the senses.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“Or it can be on the finer levels of the senses,
as an object to bind the mind,
from which stability arises.”
