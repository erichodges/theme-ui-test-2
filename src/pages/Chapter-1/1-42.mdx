#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

Another aspect of Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtra
is that he looks at the world as real.
It is Sat. It is not Asat.
It is not a mirage.
Even the mirage is real.

The evolution of Samādhi is Sthūla Savitarkā to Sthūla Nirvitarkā.
This is Viniyoga Krama, then Sūkṣma Savicārā to Sūkṣma Nirvicārā.
Commentary to Yoga Sūtra Chapter Three verse 4
Cross referencing to Yoga Sūtra Chapter One verse 42-44.

Different suggestions are available in our tradition to help the beginner arrive at the highest state of Samādhi. For example, using the image or idol of Īśvara in the form pleasant to the seeker or even a picture frame.

They will, at the proper time of day and in an appropriate place, sit and watch the idol until they can completely recall the image without having to look at it. This ability will help the person overcome the distractions from different sources when they sit for contemplation on Īśvara.

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

Sometimes our ideas about the object are so strong that,
we give up trying to see the object and just look at our ideas.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

There are stages to this coming together;
the first stage in meditational unity
is deliberation on a gross object,
intermixed with words, purpose, knowledge and imagination
around the gross object,
it is called unrefined deliberation.
