#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Abhyāsa, when performed with reverence,
without interruption, over a long period of time, will result
in a healthy body, acute senses and extraordinary alertness.
This kind of Abhyāsa is a solid foundation that nothing can disturb.”

“Abhyāsa is the practice that leads to Viveka,
the state which there are no external distractions to prevent clear perception.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“You should not get tired of
the means or the practice.”

“Satkāra –
To feel better about things than in the past.”

“Looking beyond the superficial to the source,
this is Abhyāsa.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“Yukta Abhyāsa or skilful practice.
How to cultivate as intimate a
relationship with our Practice,
as with our Problems.”

“One of the aims in Yoga is to yoke to
the more discerning aspects of the psyche,
rather than to the more distracting aspects of the psyche.”

“Having a meditation practice is one thing,
practicing meditation is something else.
Better not to confuse the two in terms of
the gap between intention and outcome.
Meditation is that which might or might not
arise out of our efforts at meditation practice.
The outcome depends on the extent of the intention.”
