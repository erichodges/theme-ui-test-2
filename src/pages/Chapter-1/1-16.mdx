# tat-paraṃ puruṣa-khyāteḥ guṇa-vaitṛṣṇyam

#### तत्परं पुरुषख्यातेः गुणवैतृष्ण्यम्

#### That higher is an absence of thirst for the attributes of nature, from a recognition of the animating principle

<br />

**tat** - that, this <br />

**para** - higher, other <br />

**puruṣa** - animating principle, self, consciousness, spirit; a person, man, a human being; people <br />

**khyāti** - recognition; perception, knowledge <br />

**guṇa** - attributes of nature; qualities <br />

**vitṛṣṇasya** - absence of thirst <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

The higher dispassion,
arising from a recognition of the true self,
is an absence of thirst,
even for the play of matter.

Yoga is about recognising change and
recognising that which recognises change.
