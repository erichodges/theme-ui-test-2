# pracchardana-vidhāraṇābhyāṃ vā prāṇasya

#### प्रच्छर्दनविधारणाभ्यां वा प्राणस्य

#### Or, through both lengthening the exhale and holding out of the breath

<br />

**pracchardana** - lengthening the exhale <br />

**vidhāraṇā** - retaining; detaining <br />

**vā** - or <br />

**prāṇa** - vital force; the breath of life; breath; inward air <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Slow and regulated breathing using special techniques
to lengthen the the inhale and exhale processes
are also helpful techniques to quieten the disturbed mind
and reduce the unpleasant consequences of this state.
Along with these breathing techniques examination of food habits
and changing them to suit is also a must.”
– T Krishnamacharya commentary to Yoga Sūtra Chapter One verse 34

“For curing an illness,
Prāṇāyāma practice of at least 24 breaths
should be done several times each day
– ideally eight times.
All other unnecessary physical activities should be curtailed.
Food should be limited to liquids – primarily milk
and hot, dry foods avoided.
Breathing practice should be done without the aid of any tools or instruments.”

“In Veda, Āyurveda and Yoga Sūtra,
various techniques are offered to aid in healing the sick.
In addition to herbs and medicines,
Patañjali suggests that Āsana, Prāṇāyāma and Vairāgya
are particularly beneficial and, as any medicine,
should be used with care and discipline.”

“It can be said that
sickness is Citta Vikṣepa
and health is Citta Nirodha.”

“In recommending Yoga practices, teachers should always consider an individual’s particular circumstances. Just as other activities and practices must be adapted to the changes in one’s life, such as ageing, so too Yoga practices need to be adapted as the practitioner changes.”

“Depending on whether the mind is in a state of Samādhi or not, the person enjoys permanent happiness or successive chains of unhappiness and happiness. Those who accept nothing short of Samādhi, freedom from the suffering of disease is realised. After all, the root cause of disease is the disturbed mind, when we cannot distinguish right from wrong or good from bad.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

Or it can be through a practice that,
both lengthens the exhalation and holding out of the breath.
