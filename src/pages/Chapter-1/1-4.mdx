**sārūpya** - conformity <br />

**itaratra** - at other times <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“What is the nature of distraction?”

“Past tendencies also determine the mind’s
direction and quality of perception.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“In Sūtra Three and Four the mind is operating.
In Sūtra Three the mind is the means.
In Sūtra Four the mind is the means and the boss.”

“The mind is like a glass through which we perceive.
When it is painted there is Rāga.
Often the painting colours what we see.
It is the colour of the mind that decides the quality of perception.”

“Perception is said to be right when something happens,
where we can see the design of the mind as well as the object.”

“Whatever perceives is always right,
it is the mind that colours what we see.”

“Yoga presumes for most people that mind is the same,
always planning ahead or basing itself on what has happened.”

“Yoga directs the mind to what is happening now.”

“If there is not a strong link to that which is inside,
the stronger force becomes the outside,
and we are pulled by and to that.”

“When the mind is not very clear,
you only get the message from the mind.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“At all other times, we identify with the fluctuations.”

“The mind modifies perception.
Though you might even say that,
the mind muddifies perception.”

“Yoga is about refining the skill
to rest in the awareness of the Cit,
rather than nest in the nature of the Citta.”

“Every step towards observing the play of the mind,
is a step towards observing the ploy of the mind.”

The less we act from within the field of the present moment,
the more we re-act from within the field of past memories.”

“It is difficult to realise the wonders of Cit
within the wanderings of the Citta.”
