#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Duḥkha is the mental activity
that brings impurities into the heart,
thus disturbing it.”

“When impurities disturb the heart,
one feels restricted and unable to move.”

“Impurities in the heart cause mental agitation
– anxiety, lack of direction, anger.
This agitation, in turn, affects the body,
sometimes making it impossible to sit still even for a few minutes.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

Suffering,
negative thinking,
unsteadiness in body and inhalation and exhalation,
are symptoms of the distractions.
