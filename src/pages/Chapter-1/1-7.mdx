#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“Perception is said to be right when something happens,
where we can see the design of the mind as well as the object.”
– TKV Desikachar commentary on Yoga Sūtra Chapter One verse 4

“Pratyakṣa (through the senses) – Direct perception
In other words the object placed in front of you.
The senses help us in comprehending the object.
Anumāna (inference) – We don’t have all the information.
We have certain indications that allow us to complete the picture.
Anu – to follow.
From the part you can get the whole.
From the effect you get to the cause.
Āgamāḥ (authentic teachings) – No information directly.
Only information is from words
Some truth that has already existed.
We take the words and believe them as if we had seen it for ourselves.
For example God.”
– TKV Desikachar France 1983

“So how do you find out these important facts?
According to Patañjali (Yoga Sūtra C1 v7) an object which can be understood by the mind can be perceived in three ways.
Pratyakṣa (through the senses),
Anumāna (inference),
Āgamāḥ (authentic teachings).”
– TKV Desikachar France 1983

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

senses,
inference and
testimony.
