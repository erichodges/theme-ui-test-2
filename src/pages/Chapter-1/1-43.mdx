#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“When we look at things, memory always intrudes.
To see clearly,
we need to be in that state described in the Yoga Sutra in Chapter One verse 43.
In such a state, memory dies, imagination vanishes,
then we can see the reality of the object.
This state is Samādhi.”
– TKV Desikachar Madras December 21st 1988

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“The next stage is refined deliberation on a gross object,
it is when the memory is purified,
as if empty of its own content,
so that only the true nature of the gross object shines forth.”

“If you remove the past from the present what is left?”
