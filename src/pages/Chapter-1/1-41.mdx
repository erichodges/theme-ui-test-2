#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

In the case of a person whose mind is calm and free from disturbances,
there is the integration of the person who meditates,
the mind which is utilised for meditation
and the object that is meditated upon.

When disturbances that take the mind everywhere but nowhere are contained, then the individual is like a high class diamond, with no blemishes.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

When the fluctuations are reduced,
the mind becomes as if a transparent gem,
able to assume the colour of whatever object is placed before it;
that coming together of,
that which is grasping,
the process of grasping
and that which is grasped,
is a state of meditational unity.
