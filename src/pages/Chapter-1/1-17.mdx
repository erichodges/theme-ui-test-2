#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

Total knowing follows the form of
deliberation on gross objects,
reflection on subtle objects,
the feeling of pure joy and
the sense of pure ‘I’ am-ness.

There are times when our Dhyāna feels like being merged with ones lover, a state full of presence, vibrancy, passion and bliss.
Tempting to want more of the same, however Yoga says we can’t have our bliss and want to repeat it.
Also Yoga reminds us that a state of bliss is different from and merely a stage towards a state of oneness.
