### [<](/Chapter-1/1-12) 1-13 &nbsp[>](/Chapter-1/1-14/)

# tatra sthitau yatnaḥ abhyāsaḥ

#### तत्र स्थितौ यत्नोऽभ्यासः

#### Practice is the effort to stay there.

<br />

**tatra** - there <br />

**sthiti** - staying or remaining or being in any state or condition; maintenance of life; <br />

**yatna** - effort <br />

**abhyāsa** - practice <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Abhyāsa is the practice of reflecting on the difference
between the nature of Jīva and the nature of Prakṛti,
which brings momentary tranquillity to the mind and
eventually leads to complete and sustained mental tranquillity.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“How do you know the use of the right means is good?”

“The spirit of Abhyāsa is to always verify the best means to go from one step to another.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

Practice is the effort to remain there.

Meditation is about the quality of the effort
rather than the fruit of the time.

In Jñāna Dhyānam the most difficult exercise for the mind
is the one of not exercising the mind.
