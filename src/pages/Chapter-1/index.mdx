#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Sages say that the fruits of this vine are three
wisdom, wealth and Joy.
Those free of desire pick wisdom
Those full of desire pick money
Those full of devotion pick the fruit of joy.
These are what the world is seeking
whether rushing forth or keeping still
But once you know the essence
of this triple bearing vine
There is no need to choose among its flavours.

Bhīṣma said Yoga’s lord is Kṛṣṇa,
beloved of all the gods
Patañjali said hold back your mind to silence the din
Nāthamuni, too, said follow the Yoga path
away from sickness, ignorance and fear.

I remember the friend of Yogavalli – Nārāyaṇa
four armed friend with bow, sword, club, discus and conch.”

“The Yoga Sūtra is divided into four chapters.
The first chapter called Samādhi Pādaḥ assumes the aspirant has progressed adequately to be in a state called Samāhita.

Such a person is not easily agitated. They have a clearer perception to comprehend concepts such as Īśvara and Vairāgya.

Yoga has no prerequisites except that one must have a teacher
and have faith in Īśvara, the first teacher.”

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“The Book on the assimilation of what thinks it perceives,
with the source of perception.”

“In the Yoga Sūtra, the pre-eminent text on Dhyānam within Yoga.
Book One is about the Process of the practice of Dhyānam;
Book Two is about the Preparation for the practice of Dhyānam;
Book Three is about the Outcome of the practice of Dhyānam;
Book Four is about the Goal of the practice of Dhyānam.”
