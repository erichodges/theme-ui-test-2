### 1-5

# vṛttayaḥ pañcatayyaḥ kliṣṭa-akliṣṭāḥ

#### वृत्तयः पञ्चतय्यः क्लिष्टाक्लिष्टाः

#### The fluctuations are fivefold and they afflict or don’t afflict

<br />

**vṛtti** - fluctuation; modification; turning; set in motion, course of action, behaviour, movement; activity, function; profession <br />

**pañcataya** - fivefold <br />

**kliṣṭa** - afflicted, tormented, distressed <br />

**akliṣṭa** - not afflicted, tormented, distressed <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“With discipline and modest fare.
Stay lean and keep the fire going in your belly.
Think of God and repeat his words
– silently and out loud.
If you want to be happy take up Yoga.
If you don’t; don’t.
Follow your Dharma.
Stay where you belong.
Sing songs and thank the sun every day.
Look sharp, a vagrant mind will lead you astray.
Practice, pay attention and be amazed.
Doubt burns up everything, including the doubter.
To banish it bow down to the Lord.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“These fluctuations fall into five groups
and can be helpful or unhelpful.”

“Rāja Yoga is the relationship we have with our thoughts,
notably those that afflict, as in knock down or weaken, us.”
