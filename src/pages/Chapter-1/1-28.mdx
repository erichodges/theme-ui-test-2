#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“To realize its purpose,
practice repetition of sacred syllables.”

“Bhakti Dhyānam uses Japa to build a bridge,
over the fear bringing streams of the mind.”

“The Yoga Sūtra become as if metaphysical Mantra,
when they can be an internal intonation,
as well as an external edification.”
