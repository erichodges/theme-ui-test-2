### 1-44

# etayā-eva savicārā nirvicārā ca sūkṣma-viṣayā vyākhyātā

#### एतयैव सविचारा निर्विचारा च सूक्ष्मविषय व्याख्याता

#### By this, thus the process of subtle reflection, without and with refinement, for subtle objects is explained

<br />

**etayā** - by this <br />

**eva** - thus <br />

**savicārā** - unrefined subtle reflection <br />

**nirvicārā** - refined subtle reflection <br />

**ca** - and <br />

**sūkṣma** - subtle; atomic; intangible <br />

**viṣaya** - object <br />

**vyākhyātā** - explained <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

By these same steps the process of reflection on a subtle object is explained,
firstly in an unrefined stage of reflection,
intermixed with words, purpose, knowledge and imagination around that object,
and then in a refined stage,
with a purification of memory,
so as if empty of its own content;
in the refined stage of reflection,
only the true nature of the subtle object shines forth.
