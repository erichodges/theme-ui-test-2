**pratyaya** - psychic activity; cause; conception, assumption, notion, idea; <br />

**abhyāsa** - practice <br />

**pūrva** - preceding <br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“All mental distractions arise from the free play of the senses
and only through continuing practice can one keep their power in check.”

‎”Trying to escape from Saṃskāra only increases their power and,
in addition, leads to the acquisition of still more Saṃskāra.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“Samādhi is a state of mind and an understanding that arises from it.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

Other than this is the practice where only tendencies remain,
it is preceded by the cessation of psychic activity.
