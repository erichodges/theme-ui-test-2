# duḥkha-anuśayī dveṣaḥ

#### दुःखानुशयी द्वेषः

#### Aversion is the consequence of suffering

<br />

**duḥkha** - suffering, pain, sorrowful <br />

**anuśayin** - following upon, connected with as a consequence <br />

**dveṣa** - aversion; hatred; animosity; dislike; repugnance <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

What is unpleasant is not desired.
The response of the mind is then to move away from it.
Whether in fact such a step did prevent Duḥkha is not immediately evident.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“Dveṣa is the consequence
of Duḥkha from such as,
getting what you are not expecting or,
getting other than what you are expecting.”
