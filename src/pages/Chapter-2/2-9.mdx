**samā** - equal, constant; fair, impartial towards; like to or identical with <br />

**rūḍha** - springing up; grown, produced from <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Abhiniveśā is the extra-ordinairy instinctive urge to survive at any cost.
No one is spared.
In a way it is a dislike about one’s death.”

“There are essentially three causes for fear….
desire, disease and death.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“Fear and Insecurity feed on the leftovers
from the meals of past experiences.”

“Yoga is about looking inwards,
at what we fear most.
Rather than looking outwards,
at what we desire most.”
