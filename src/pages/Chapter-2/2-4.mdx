#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

All these Kleśa are variable in their potency.
They can be so weak, that they hardly matter.
Sometime they take a feeble form, when they can be easily contained.
If not they rise to dominance. When in domination, only one takes over.
For example in the most evolved stage when Rāga is dominant, other Kleśa such as Dveṣa are not apparent.
