#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“These five Kleśa surround the heart of every individual.
They are related to the three Guṇa known as Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.
As long as one chooses not to inquire into the true nature of one’s self and acts mechanically,
they will unknowingly contribute to the dominance of the Kleśa.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“Avidyā is anything else other than Vidyā.”

“We may have intellectual Vidyā,
but in reality we follow some deeper force of Avidyā.”
