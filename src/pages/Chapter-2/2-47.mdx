#### प्रयत्नशैथिल्यानन्तसमापत्तिभ्याम्

#### Both relaxation of continued effort and unity in the infinite

<br />

**prayatna** - continued effort

**śaithilya** - decrease; looseness; relaxation

**ananta** - endless, boundless, eternal, infinite; the first serpent

**samāpatti** - coming together, unity

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

The practice of Āsana without breathing and without remembering Ananta has no value.

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

The test for intelligent effort is the response of the Breath.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“The experience known as Sthira Sukham Āsanam,
described in Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 46,
arises as a fruit of Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 47,
from melding the mastery of outer stillness in the world,
described as Prayatna Śaithilya, or relaxation of continued effort,
with the mystery of inner openness to the beyond,
described as Ananta Samāpatti, or unity in the infinite.”
– Reflections on Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 46

“When working with the Breath in Āsana it's perhaps less appealing initially,
but ultimately more attractive, satisfactory and effective,
to integrate a focus of Samāpatti (Unity) of
Śaithilya (Relaxation) in Ananta (the Infinite),
through a developmental Sādhana (Means to Accomplish)
on the Siddhi (accomplishment) of Dīrgha or Length,
supported by Sūkṣma or Subtlety.

From Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 47 T Krishnamacharya taught that:
– the common denominator for successfully uniting (Samāpatti)
both (Bhyām) aspects of relaxation (Śaithilya) and the infinite (Ananta)
within the practice of Āsana is the Breath.
He saw it as Prayatna (continued effort)
and synonymous with Jīvana (giving life).
The continued effort of the Breath is that which gives life.”

“Our continued effort
with the breath in Āsana
is that which helps to enliven
our various levels of interaction
with our inner and outer worlds as
expressed through the Pañca Maya.”
– Reflections on Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 47

“Two primary roles in the adaptation of Āsana
to the needs and potential of the student are
Facilitating a decrease of tension within the body
whilst
Facilitating an increase of attention within the breath.”
– Reflections on Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 47
