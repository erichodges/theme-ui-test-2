**tat** - that, this

**abhāva** - non-appearance, non-existence, absence

**saṃyoga** - conjunction

**hāna** - the act of abandoning, relinquishing, giving up, escaping, getting rid of; gone or departed; cessation

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Avidyā and Freedom do not exist together.
Here Avidyā represents both the basis and attitude towards our action.
The aim of Yoga is to reach that state where our actions are not based on Avidyā.”
