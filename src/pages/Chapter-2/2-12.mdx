#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

What effects Kleśa have on us?
They affect our actions and the results are evident sooner or later.
Further they decide, in spite of us, what we do and don’t.
Our actions will be beyond our control, so are the consequences.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“When seeking the power of the light,
take care lest we forget the power of our roots.”
