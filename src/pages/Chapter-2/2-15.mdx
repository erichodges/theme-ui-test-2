#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

Only a teacher who has experienced Duḥkha can heal others Duḥkha.

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

Duḥkha is the expression of a problem.
Duḥkha is an emotion, it could be an illusion.

Suffering is basically either the result of the absence of something that we want, or the presence of something that we don’t want.

We are always experiencing Duḥkha even though some of us might not be seeking clarity.
Recognising AND accepting one’s Duḥkham is the first Prajñā.
Once you have accepted this you are free to find out where it is coming from..

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“There are some who are ruled by how they perceive the world as treating them.
There are others who reflect on how they are treating the world.”
