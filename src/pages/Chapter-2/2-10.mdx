#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

Kleśa are not always dominant.
Through Kriyā Yoga they become weaker and weaker.
How is it possible to completely subdue them?
No mental effort can help as Mind is the storehouse of the Kleśa.

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

Meditation is the process of moving backwards.
