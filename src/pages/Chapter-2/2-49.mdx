#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

It is possible only after a reasonable mastery of Āsana Practice.
Prāṇāyāma leads to this.
Pratyāhāra, to see without the senses distracting or pulling the mind, and
Dhāraṇā, to see without the mind losing itself, because of colouring or expectations.
Dhyānam arises out of this.
