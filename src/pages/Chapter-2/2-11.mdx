#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

When Kleśa are on the move, time should not be lost.
Reflection is a must.
Reduction of all the factors that increase Rajas and Tamas,
including right food, company, study and Niyama is a must.
Without them, reflection leading to a reduction of the power of Kleśa will not work.
