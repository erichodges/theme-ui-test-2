#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“The perception that something is desirable is Sukha.
This perception sets in motion an urge to possess it.
This is Rāga.
Whether what is desired will give a lasting happiness is a different matter.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“Rāga is attraction to an object before you are aware of it.
An attraction whether you need it or not.
In its absence you crave for it.”

“Rāga – Something in us needs to be satisfied.”

“The mind is like a glass through which we perceive.
When it is painted there is Rāga.
Often the painting colours what we see.
It is the colour of the mind that decides the quality of perception.”
