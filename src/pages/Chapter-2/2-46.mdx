“Sthira Sukha should both be present in Āsana.
It also implies one should be able to choose the breath ratio.”
– TKV Desikachar England 1980

Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 46 Sthira Sukham Āsanam
“Means what happens before and after a posture.
One should be able to move to another posture with ease.
– TKV Desikachar England 1980

“Sthira is the absence of Rajas.”
– TKV Desikachar commentary on Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 46

“In the Yoga Sūtra,
Āsana is basically something linked to Prāṇāyāma,
since Prāṇāyāma is a very important practice there,
linked to Dhāraṇā.”
– TKV Desikachar commentary on Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 46

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“This verse is commenting on the attainment of an Āsana as
an appurtenance, or foundation for more subtle practices.
Better not to confuse the vehicle with the direction.”
– Reflection on Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 46

“The experience known as Sthira Sukham Āsanam,
described in Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 46,
arises as a fruit of Yoga Sūtra Chapter Two verse 47,
from melding the mastery of outer stillness in the world,
described as Prayatna Śaithilya, or relaxation of continued effort,
with the mystery of inner openness to the beyond,
described as Ananta Samāpatti, or unity in the infinite.”
