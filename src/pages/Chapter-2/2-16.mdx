# heyaṃ duḥkham-anāgatam

#### हेयं दुःखमनागतम्

#### The suffering not yet come must be overcome

<br />

**heya** - overcome <br />

**duḥkha** - suffering, pain, sorrowful <br />

**anāgata** - not yet come <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“The way to better oneself is not to ponder over the past but to look ahead.
Even Duḥkha is a great teacher.
In fact it is the first and important step in the ladder of Viveka or clarity.
The greatness of Patañjali is to look at Duḥkha as the stepping stone to success.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

The only Duḥkha that matters is that which is about to come.

Things that have happened or are happening must be accepted.

‎Where there is Duḥkha, there is Avidyā.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

Duḥkha is the space in the heart feeling constricted through:
‘Not getting what you want’
or
‘Getting what you don’t want’.
