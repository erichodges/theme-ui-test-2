# viveka-khyātiḥ aviplavā-hāna-upāyaḥ

#### विवेकख्यातिरविप्लवा हानोपायः

#### Unwavering recognition of discrimination is the approach for giving up

<br />

**viveka** - discrimination, discernment; the faculty of distinguishing and classifying things according to their real properties; the power of separating the invisible Spirit from the visible world (or spirit from matter); truth from untruth

**khyāti** - recognition; perception, knowledge

**aviplavā** - unwavering

**hāna** - the act of abandoning, relinquishing, giving up, escaping, getting rid of; gone or departed; cessation

**upāya** - approach, coming near; that by which one reaches one's aim, a means, way, stratagem, craft

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

“All (Yoga) techniques are for Viveka,
as this is the means for freedom.”

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“Some define their experience of life by seeking Duḥkha,
some by seeking Sukha.
The Yoga Practitioner sees both as Avidyā
and defines their experience of life by seeking
what lies beyond duality through unwavering Viveka.”
