# sādhana-pādaḥ

### साधनपादः

<br />

**The section on the Means to accomplish**

<br />

**sādhana** - means to accomplish; leading straight to a goal; guiding well; furthering <br />

**pāda** - section; a quarter, a fourth part; foot, leg; on foot; the act of locomotion <br />

<br />

#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“What about others who are known as Vyutthita Citta,
a mind easily prone to agitations and distractions?

This second chapter known as Sādhana Pādaḥ caters to them.”

<br />

#### Commentary by TKV Desikachar:

Chapter Two is for those who want to move to the state of Chapter One.

Whether Yoga is Sādhana or Siddhi?
Sādhana is the means to achieve something.
Siddhi is where something has happened.
For Siddhi to happen there has to be Sādhana, some preparation, some effort.
So how is it possible for something to be both Sādhana and Siddhi?
Each gain we make is a Siddhi.
Each Siddhi helps us to go further with Sādhana.

<br />

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“More usually the past dominates the present.
Through Yoga Sādhana we work towards the present dominating the past.”
