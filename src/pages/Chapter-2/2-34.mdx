#### Commentary by T Krishnamacharya:

“Mano Vikāra –
Some actions I have done I have not got what I want.
Therefore this brings out certain changes
in certain mental processes and
a change in bodily activity.”

“Today this world is ‘standing’ on Vitarka
and it expands because of association.
It grows without any effort.
One has to put in special effort (Sādhana).
Otherwise nothing changes.”

#### Commentary by Paul Harvey:

“Negative reasoning such as harming and the rest;
may be done, brought about, or by approval;
is preceded by greed, anger or delusion;
may be mild, moderate or intense;
its infinite fruits are suffering and ignorance;
thus cultivate the opposite side.”
